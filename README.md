# E09a-Scripting

For this project we were assigned to take our previous paddle game and add a score and lives counter, as well as a game over page. I also changed the color order of the tiles to rainbow order for fun.

The player bounces the ball off of the paddle to collect the tiles and get a high score, and if the ball falls below the paddle the player loses a life. To spawn a new ball, the player clicks on the mouse. Should the lives reach 0, a black page that says Game Over! in big letters will appear.
